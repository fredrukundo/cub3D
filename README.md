# cub3D
The cub3D project enhances skills in C programming and basic algorithms while focusing on graphic design elements like windows, colors, events, and shape filling. The goal is to create a realistic 3D maze from a first-person perspective using ray-casting principles, applying mathematics to develop efficient algorithms with online resources.
